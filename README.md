This is a repository where I will upload all my activities related to the web interfaces development course. In this term we used Gulp, Webpack, Cordova and Android Studio and also tools to develop web applications such as npm, node.js.

Dependencies aimed to improve our code readibility, compatibility and organization like Babel, EsLint.
